# Wayfinder
Wayfinder is the second web application I built in a node.js/express.js framework. I completed the initial prototype MVP in about 9 days.

## How it Works
Wayfinder enables its users to build and share maps as a way of telling their stories about living in and visiting
places around the world.  Users can also learn from others by viewing the maps others have created. Anyone can browse user-created
maps, but you must create an account to build your own. To find out more, visit the site at http://wayfinder.so.

## Framework
Wayfinder is a full-stack JavaScript MVC web application built in a node.js/ExpressJS server-side framework. It uses
a PostgreSQL database.

## APIs, JavaScript Libraries, and NPM Modules used
Google Maps API, Bootstrap, jQuery, express, ejs, body-parser, bcrypt, geocoder, and sequelize.
